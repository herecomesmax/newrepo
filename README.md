# Capstone Project
## Overview
In this project, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of **62** million dollars; other providers cost upward of **165** million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can **reuse the first stage**. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch.
